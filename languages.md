**Programming Language Popularity**

As a developer, I follow the trend of programming languages to understand the shift in the job market. The popularity of these languages not only impacts daily development but also refects the trend of tech domains, because programming languages come with frequently used fields. Say PHP, Ruby for web development, swift for iOS, scala for big data, python / R for data analysis.
