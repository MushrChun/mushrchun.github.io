## Programming Language Popularity

As a developer, I normally follow the trend of programming languages to understand the job market better. The popularity of these languages not only impact daily development but also refect the tech trend. Because programming languages come with frequently used domains. Say PHP, Ruby for web development, swift for iOS, scala for big data, python / R for data analysis. Roughly, we can predict if the era of AI has come based on the ranking of languages.
