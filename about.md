## :rice_scene: Background
I'm currently a full stack web developer albeit I hope I could work as a more generic software engineer or a problem solver.

When I was young I was fascinated by the diversity of the Internet. So I picked network engineering as my major in the university, where I thought network engineering is all about building the Internet. I was half right after I notice network engineering offer the backbone of the Internet and information forms its blood. Fortunately, I got the chance to take a master degree in software engineer, which empower myself and make me understand what's actually behind the Internet - Computation, storage and distribution of information.

based on this understanding, I'm keen to explore the world of the Internet during my lifetime

## :heart: Tech Interests
I enjoy reading anything about software architecture or design pattern. 

Client-side application development including building Android native, iOS native and Web single page application is my current strength.

Looking for more backend oriented positions such as cloud engineers.
